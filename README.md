How It Works
The project uses Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture.

The employee_data app handles all CRUD functionality.

Forms are rendered using Django Crispy Forms for clean layout.

The homepage provides a form to insert or update an employee.

A separate view lists all existing employees with options to edit or delete.

This project is open source and available under the MIT License.

Let me know if you'd like to personalize it further (like adding your name, LinkedIn, or screenshots). I can also generate the `requirements.txt` if needed.
