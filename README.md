- Delete employee records  
- Form validation using Django Forms and Crispy Forms  
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap  

## Technologies Used

- MySQL 
- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)  
- Django Crispy Forms

### How It Works
The project follows Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture.

All CRUD operations are handled within the employee_data app.

Employee forms are rendered using Django Crispy Forms for a responsive and user-friendly layout.

The homepage allows adding or editing employee data.

A separate list view displays all employee records with options to update or delete.
